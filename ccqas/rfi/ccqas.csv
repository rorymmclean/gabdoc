This includes decisions about how to identify and assess risks, how to implement risk mitigation strategies, and how to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies.

2. Clinical Quality Review of Adverse Events and Actions: The DSS would assist in making decisions about the review of adverse events and actions in the clinical setting. This includes decisions about how to identify and assess these events and actions, how to respond to them, and how to prevent them from occurring in the future.

3. Release of Information: The DSS would help in making decisions about the release of information related to healthcare risk management. This includes decisions about what information to release, to whom, and in what format.

In summary, a decision support system connected to these systems would assist in making a wide range of decisions related to the collection and management of data, the granting and monitoring of privileges, the management of risks, the review of adverse events and actions, and the release of information."
